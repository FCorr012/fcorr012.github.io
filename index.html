        <div class="subheading mb-5">Global StudiesðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first year undergraduate student enrolled at the University of California, Riverside. I am set to graduate in 2027. I take my education very seriously, and I have since the age of 10. I took several AP classes during my time in high school for the sole purpose of getting ahead in credits in college. My strengths are in reading and writing, specifically the English and History side of school subjects. I've never failed a class or had a grade below a B, so my skills in the Math and Science side of subjects are also adequate, especially since I took advanced math classes till my high school graduation. I hold great skills like critical thinking and problem solving especially high as they allow me to solve day to day problems in addition to academics. Additionally, skills like communication and the ability to work as a team are also attributes that I value and use on a day to day basis in both my personal and professional life. <br><br>

        As for the career side of my life, I started by helping a local church during high school with tasks like putting away equipment and helping babysit during a friend's Bible study. The summer before starting college, I started my current job at the popular retail chain, Best Buy. Currently, I have been in my position at Bets Buy for almost a year, and it has provided with with the ability to have a small income for college fees and weekly necessities like buying food. I am grateful for the opportunities it has provided me, even if minimal. In result, I am able to strengthen my communication skills and ability to work well as a team. The company relies on the ability of its team members to work as a team in effort of providing customers with the best deals and products. I work in the warehouse or inventory side of Best Buy, my tasks when on site are to ensure online orders are "picked" from the floor or the back inventory and placed in their corresponding are according to the item's classification or the customer's last initial. I also pack such orders when the order is requested to be shipped to the customer's home. Furthermore, if the customer requests their order to be a "curbside pickup," then I also take orders ranging from televisions to small cables out to the customer's car and give it to them after receiving a confirmation code. And lastly, in a process called down-stocking, I take products from the inventory that need to be placed onto the store floor after there are no more remaining items of any certain classification left available. I enjoy working with my colleagues in order to get tasks done or just engaging in casual conversation in our off time. I do believe I provide a valuable position to my store and meet all requirements whenever on duty without being asked, so I entrust that I will have this job until I graduate from the University of California, Riverside in 2027 before I transition to my planned career.<br><br>

        My plan for post-graduation in 2027 is to start a G.I.S. certification program at my local community college, Mt. San Jacinto College, in the pursuit of becoming a Geographic Information Systems (G.I.S.) Analyst. In order to accomplish this plan, I will graduate with my degree in Global Studies (or any humanities equivalent) and end my position at Best Buy on good terms in order to transition towards my career with my full focus. I plan to be a G.I.S Analyst for as long as economically possible, providing I adapt to the changing world and learn the principles of artificial intelligence (A.I.) and its application in G.I.S. work during my certification process or career. This ensures my position as a G.I.S Analyst will not become obsolete in the coming decades of technological change. I already have a basic foundation of preparation needed with familiarizing myself with concepts such as Microsoft Excel, basic coding in HTML and Python, and A.I. itself. All of these skills were provided to me during middld school or high school and/or am currently acquiring these skills at the University of California, Riverside. With these steps taken, I will ensure my future is not only bright, but secured in the scenario of economic hardship and technological advancement.
